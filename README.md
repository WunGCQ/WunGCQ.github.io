================

This is the source code of Wung Chunqi's blog, generated by Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages.

### Building & Running

To build the site, navigate to the source code directory and execute `jekyll --build`, a sub-directory named `_site` will be created containing all the generated files. To run the site, simply run `jekyll --serve`, you will be able to see the result in `http://127.0.0.1:4000`.

### File Structure

Jekyll is a text transformation engine, which takes template and content as input and produce rendered html files as output.

File `_config.yml` contains about the site, `_posts` directory contains posts written in markup language whose file name must in forms of `YYYY-MM-DD-post-name.{md|html}`. `_layouts` is a place for template files, which can include partials located in `_includes`.

Besides those files and directories used by jekyll, any other files or directories will be copied directly to generated site.
